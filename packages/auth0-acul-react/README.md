## üöÄ Getting started

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure that you have the following setup:

1. **Custom Domain**: Ensure that a custom domain is configured for your Auth0 tenant.
2. **Screen Configuration**: Set up the required authentication screens within your Auth0 flow.  
   For detailed steps, refer to the [Configure ACUL Screens](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/login-pages/advanced-customizations/getting-started/configure-acul-screens).

### Installation

```bash
npm install @auth0/auth0-acul-react
```

Peer dependency:
```bash
npm install react
```

### Importing the SDK
The SDK supports `partial imports` for each screen, allowing you to include only the code you need for your specific use case. This helps keep your bundle size small and improves performance. 

Also, you can use a `root import` to load all screens from a single bundle if your app requires it. 

#### Partial Imports
Each screen has its own set of hooks and methods. You can import only what you need for the screen you're building.

The following example shows how to import and use SDK to build `login-id` screen.
```tsx
import { 
  // Context hooks
  useUser,
  useTenant,
  useBranding,
  useClient,
  useOrganization,
  usePrompt,
  useScreen,
  useTenant,
  useTransaction,
  useUser,
  useUntrustedData,
  // Common hooks
  useErrors,
  useTexts,
  // Utility hooks
  useUsernameValidation,
  usePasswordValidation,
  useLoginIdentifiers,
  // Submit methods
  login,
  passkeyLogin,
  federatedLogin,
} from '@auth0/auth0-acul-react/login-id';
```

---

#### Root Imports

The SDK also supports a root import, which lets you load all screens from a single bundle.
This is useful if your app dynamically renders different screens at runtime based on the current Auth0 flow, for example, when you want one unified build that can handle all possible screens.

However, root imports aren‚Äôt ideal for most projects since they can increase bundle size.
If you only need specific screens, use partial imports instead for better performance.

```ts
import {
  // Common hooks
  useCurrentScreen,
  useAuth0Themes,
  useErrors,

  // Screen-specific hooks for multiple screens
  useLoginId,
  useSignupId,
  useResetPassword
} from '@auth0/auth0-acul-react';
```
---

#### Types / Interfaces
Typescript types and interfaces can be imported from `@auth0/auth0-acul-react/types` for type safety and better DX.
```tsx
import type {
  Connection,
  CustomOptions,
  IdentifierType,
  Organizations,
  EnrolledDevice
  // ...other types
} from '@auth0/auth0-acul-react/types';
```
Refer to our [API Reference](#-api-reference) for the full list of available types and interfaces.
