<a id="quick-start"></a>

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Auth0 CLI login: (Follow Auth0 CLI Installation steps)

   ```bash
   auth0 login
   ```

   - This will open a browser window for you to log in to your Auth0 account
   - Make sure to select the correct tenant if you have multiple tenants. Choose development tenants for testing.
   - Make sure the selected tenant has a custom domain configured.

2. Set up your environment variables in `.env.local`:

   ```env
   # Auth0 Configuration
   AUTH0_CUSTOM_DOMAIN='https://your-custom-domain.com'
   AUTH0_CLIENT_ID='your-client-id'
   AUTH0_AUDIENCE='your-audience'

   # Optional
   AUTH0_ORGANIZATION='optional_org_id'
   ```

3. Start development:

   ```bash
   # Standard mode (single screen)
   # This uses Universal Login mode to see the screen configured in your tenant
   npm run screen:standard <screen_name>
   npm run screen:standard login  # Examples: login, login-id, login-password

   # Advanced mode with Hot Module Replacement (single screen)
   # This uses ACUL (advanced mode) to see the screen being developed locally
   npm run screen:advanced <screen_name>
   npm run screen:advanced login  # Examples: login, login-id, login-password
   ```

4. Access in browser:
   - Screen Tester: `http://localhost:4040/`
   - After clicking "Log In" in the tester, you will be redirected to your custom login screen

## 🖥️ Screens

This boilerplate includes implementations for several Universal Login screens:

- **[Login Screen](src/screens/Login/README.md)**

  - Main login screen with username/email and password
  - Customizable with your design system

- **[Login ID Screen](src/screens/login-id/README.md)**

  - Username/email input step in a multi-step login flow
  - Follows modern authentication patterns

- **[Login Password Screen](src/screens/login-password/README.md)**
  - Password entry step in a multi-step login flow
  - Secure password entry with validation

Each screen comes with its own documentation. Check the README.md file in each screen directory for more information.

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Standard Mode Development

Use standard mode when you want to test your screen with the configuration already set up in your Auth0 tenant:

```bash
npm run screen:standard login
```

This command:

1. Configures your Auth0 tenant to use standard mode for the specified screen
2. Launches the Screen Tester application for initiating the authentication flow
3. Any changes to the tenant configuration will be reflected in the login experience

### Advanced Mode Development

Use advanced mode when actively developing your custom screen:

```bash
npm run screen:advanced login
```

This command:

1. Builds your screen and serves it locally with Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
2. Configures your Auth0 tenant to use advanced mode with your local assets
3. Launches the Screen Tester application for initiating the authentication flow
4. Any changes to your code will be immediately reflected without page reloads

## 📤 Deployment

### Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions

This boilerplate includes a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the process of:

1. Building your customized ACUL screens
2. Uploading the assets to an AWS S3 bucket
3. Configuring your Auth0 tenant to use these assets in Advanced mode
4. Serving the assets through a CDN for optimal performance

**For detailed setup instructions including AWS S3, CloudFront, IAM roles, Auth0 M2M applications, and GitHub secrets, please refer to the comprehensive deployment guide:**

➡️ **[DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md)**

### Key Deployment Features

- **Content-Based Asset Hashing**: All assets include content hashes for proper cache invalidation
- **CDN Integration**: Assets are served through CloudFront or your preferred CDN
- **Partial Deployments**: The workflow succeeds even if some screens fail to deploy
- **Automatic Screen Discovery**: No need to manually update configuration when adding new screens
