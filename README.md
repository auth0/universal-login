## ACUL Overview
![ACUL Overview](https://cdn.auth0.com/website/sdks/assets/auth0-acul-overview.png) 




##  Getting started

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure that you have the following setup:

1. **Custom Domain**: Ensure that a custom domain is configured for your Auth0 tenant.
2. **Screen Configuration**: Set up the required authentication screens within your Auth0 flow.  
   For detailed steps, refer to the [Configure ACUL Screens](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/login-pages/advanced-customizations/getting-started/configure-acul-screens).

### Installation

You can easily install the SDK via [npm](https://npmjs.org):

```sh
npm install @auth0/auth0-acul-js
```


After installing the SDK, you can import the relevant screen module, which you want to configure

### Importing Screens

```js
// Default import of any particular screen, eg: login-id screen
import  LoginId  from '@auth0/auth0-acul-js/login-id'; 

// Named import of any screen
import  { LoginId }  from '@auth0/auth0-acul-js'; 

// Default import of all screens
import  * as Screens  from '@auth0/auth0-acul-js'; 

```
Note: For more details on import paths for all screens, refer to the [FAQ's](FAQ.md).

## Usage

### Adding Functionality to Your Screens

Let‚Äôs look at an example for adding logic to the `login-id` screen.

#### Example: Add Logic to Login Button
```typescript
  import  LoginId  from '@auth0/auth0-acul-js/login-id';

  const loginIdManager = new LoginId();

  // Trigger the login method on button click
  loginIdManager.login({
    username: <USERNAME_FIELD_VALUE>
  });
``` 

#### Get List of Mandatory Fields for Login
 ```typescript
 const { transaction } = loginIdManager
 const requiredFields = transaction.getActiveIdentifiers();
 ```

 #### Integrating Social Connections for Login
To allow users to login via social connections (e.g., Google, Facebook), use the following snippet

```typescript
import  LoginId  from "@auth0/auth0-acul-js/login-id";
const loginIdManager = new LoginId();

// Check if alternateConnections is available and has at least one item
if (!loginIdManager.transaction.getAlternateConnections()) {
  console.error('No alternate connections available.');
}

// Select the first available connection (users can select any available connection)
const selectedConnection = alternateConnections[0];

// Log the chosen connection for debugging or informational purposes
console.log(`Selected connection: ${selectedConnection.name}`);

// Proceed with social login using the selected connection
loginIdManager.continueWithFederatedLogin({
  connection: selectedConnection.name,
})
```
