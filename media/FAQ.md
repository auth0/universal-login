## Where can i see errors related to my screen

The SDK provides multiple ways to detect and view errors during the process:

1. **Screen-Specific Errors**  
   Each screen includes a `transaction.getErrors()` method, which returns a list of errors specific to that screen. These errors are generated after the final validation of the request, helping you identify issues that need attention.

2. **Submit Handler Errors**  
   The SDK may throw errors if invalid parameters are passed to the submit handler. These errors occur when validation fails and can be caught during the submission process.

By using these methods, you can easily track and resolve errors throughout the SDK flow.
